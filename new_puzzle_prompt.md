# 🧩 Puzzle Page Builder

I'm building a puzzle website and need two things for a new puzzle:

## 1. A complete HTML puzzle page

Build it to match this style:

- Purple gradient background: `linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%)`
- White card container with `border-radius: 20px` and `box-shadow: 0 20px 60px rgba(0,0,0,0.3)`
- Primary color `#667eea`, secondary `#764ba2`
- Font: `Segoe UI`
- A timer that starts when the page loads
- Rules visible on screen at all times (no modal to hide them)
- A winner modal at the end with the completion time, a "Close" button, and a "Reset & Play Again" button
- Same general structure and feel as the other pages on my site

## 2. A short index card blurb

For adding to my homepage `puzzles` array, in this exact format:
{
title: "...",
icon: "...", // a single relevant emoji
description: "...", // 1-2 sentences, enticing but no spoilers
file: "...", // snake_case filename ending in .html
releaseDate: "YYYY-MM-DD",
},
